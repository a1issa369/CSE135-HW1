## Free Choice Analytics Platform 
I considered Matomo, Plausible, and Plausible Community Edition. These initial candidates were drawn from suggestions by Claude Sonnet and thus were selected with the popularity bias inherent to LLMs. I was initially drawn to Matomo as a learning opportunity, since it is self-hosted and requires more set up than Plausible, Google Tag Manager, or Log Rocket. 

I ultimately chose Plausible (using a 30-day free trial of their cloud-based version) due to time constraints, since setup was identical to the other two I tried (just pasting a script tag). 

However, this is not the only factor that attracted me to Plausible. 

As someone who cares deeply about data privacy, it was appealing to me that Plausible is GDPR-compliant out of the box. To add on to this point, Plausible tracks without using cookies. This of course comes with the downside that it provides less detailed user data than GTM. I also didn’t see an option for screen replays as was available in Log Rocket. 

Plausible being open-source is another double-edged sword. It’s awesome to have a free, configurable option, but based on Prof. Powell’s lecture, I can only assume it will fall into disrepair. That being said, I’m fairly confident it will be running for the duration of this class. The fact that it has a paid tier also leads me to believe that it will continue to be actively developed. 

I appreciated the dashboard link-sharing feature, which includes a choice between password protection and making my analytics visible on the open internet. 

As a broke college student, I also need to balance price considerations with features and learning opportunities. I hope to transition our server to Plausible Community Edition when our free trial expires so that I can learn to self-host it.

## Additional Notes 
We were unable to view data on the Google Tag Manager Dashboard prior to the deadline, as it takes at least 24 hours to populate. The screenshot we submitted shows analytics data displayed on the Realtime Overview page.
